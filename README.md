# Rails-Engine

Rails Engine is an API that provides endpoints for item and merchant information for a simulated e-commerce website. It allows a client to create and modify items via the API, as well as search functionality for names and min/max prices. 


## Getting Started

Fork and clone repo into the desired directory.

### Prerequisites

ruby v 2.7.2 or higher
rails v 5.2.6 or higher

### Installing

As a Rails application, begin installation by running </$ bundle install> from the command line while in the root directory of the application folder. 

Next, run </$ rake db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}> to set up the database. 

Finally, run </$ rails db:schema:dump> and confirm that /db/schema exists and has content.

The application can be run on a local server via the command </$ rails s> and accessed via any application that can perform API calls, such as Postman.

The application can also be deployed to a remote server such as Heroku.

## Running the tests
Local tests have been constructed in both RSPEC within the /spec directory of the app as well as Postman API tests. The postman API tests are available here:

[Section 2](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/rails_engine_lite/RailsEngineSection2.postman_collection.json)

RSPEC:

From the root directory of the application, run </$ bundle exec rspec > in your command line. Test results will be returned to the terminal. Information about line-by-line test coverage will be automatically generated by the SimpleCov gem each time the test suite is executed, and can be reviewed by opening 'coverage/index.html'
